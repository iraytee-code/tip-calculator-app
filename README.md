## Overview

## The challenge

the challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

- I set up the base project by _creating the GitHub repository_, _setting up global styling_, _including the required assets_, and so on. I then proceeded to code the calculator sections of the project and after I was done, then i worked on the javascript to ensure interactivity between the userand the system.

During the entire project life cycle i followed courses online to get  thoughts and ideas on how to make the project meet web standards and kept track of our overall progress.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape: Open Source Scalable Vector Graphics Editor

### What I learned

-  Before this project, I had no idea that you could set mutliple images to show for different screen sizes using the `<picture>` element.

```javascript
function calcTip(e) {
    // increase opacity of reset button
    document.getElementById("reset").style.opacity = 1;
    // check if coming from fixed value tips
    e? errorHandler(e.target):null;
    // checks for error input ... must be all valid to calculate
    if(customTip.checkValidity() && bill.checkValidity()
             && people.checkValidity() && people.value != ""){
                totalTip = (tip * bill.value) /100;
                tipPerPerson = totalTip / people.value;
                totalPerPerson = (Number(bill.value) + totalTip) / people.value;
                tipPersonElement.innerHTML = round(tipPerPerson);
                totalPersonElement.innerHTML = round(totalPerPerson);
    }
}
```

### Continued development

-  I want to apply the features and best practices that I've learnt from working on this project to future projects.
